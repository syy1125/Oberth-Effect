Info:
  ShortName: Fuel Engine
  FullName: Small Fuel Engine
  Description: |
    A fuel-guzzling engine that uses chemical reaction to generate thrust.
    The thrust force generated is much higher than its ion-based counterparts, but fuel supply often can only last a short time before running out.
    Like all engines, the fuel engine needs time to ramp up its thrust, making it unsuitable for maneuvering.
