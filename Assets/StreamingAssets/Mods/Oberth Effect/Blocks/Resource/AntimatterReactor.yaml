Info:
  ShortName: Antimatter Reactor
  FullName: Matter-Antimatter Annihilation Reactor
  Description: |
    The antimatter reactor is a powerful energy provider, but using it comes at quite a risk.
    When destroyed by enemy fire, the stored antimatter fuel rapidly annihilates with nearby matter, creating a large explosion.
    The reactor is hardened somewhat against enemy fire to help with this issue, but it is still quite fragile when subjected to concentrated fire.
